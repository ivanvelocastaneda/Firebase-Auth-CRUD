# Firebase-Auth-CRUD
Assignment Description: You are required to continue developing your midterm shopping cart application by integrating Firebase for data management and implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The application allows users to view a list of products, add products to a shopping cart, and manage the items in the cart. You need to follow the instructions below to complete the assignment.

Requirements:
npm install firebase
npm install bootstrap
npm install react-bootstrap
npm install react-router-dom
npm install react-multi-carousel

When you create you firebase app, you firebaseConfig function will be different than the one provided here.  

Instructions:

Initialize Firebase: a. Create a Firebase account if you don't have one. b. Create a new Firebase project for this assignment. c. Get the Firebase configuration settings (apiKey, authDomain, projectId, etc.) from the Firebase console. d. Install the Firebase SDK in your ReactJS application using npm or yarn. e. Set up Firebase in your ReactJS application by initializing it with the configuration settings obtained in step c.
Authentication: a. Implement Firebase authentication in your application to allow users to sign up and log in. b. Create sign-up and log-in forms/components that capture user input for email and password. c. Implement Firebase's authentication methods (such as createUserWithEmailAndPassword, signInWithEmailAndPassword, etc.) to handle user sign-up and log-in functionality. d. Display appropriate error messages for failed sign-up/log-in attempts. e. Add a log-out functionality using Firebase's signOut method.
CRUD Operations: a. Implement CRUD operations for managing products in the shopping cart using Firebase's Realtime Database or Firestore. b. Create components for displaying a list of products, adding products to the cart, updating product quantities, and removing products from the cart. c. Implement Firebase's database methods (such as set, get, update, remove, etc.) to perform CRUD operations on product data. d. Use Firebase's real-time syncing capabilities to keep the cart data in sync across multiple devices/browsers.
UI/UX: a. Enhance the user interface and user experience of the application to make it visually appealing and user-friendly. b. Implement proper error handling and validation to provide a seamless experience to users. c. Add appropriate loading indicators or placeholders to indicate asynchronous operations.

Submission Requirements:
Submit the GitHub repository link of your completed assignment.
Include a README file in your repository with instructions on how to run and use your application.
Provide a brief explanation of your implementation choices, challenges faced, and any additional features or improvements made.
Grading Criteria:

Successful integration of Firebase in the ReactJS shopping cart application ( 8 points)

Proper implementation of CRUD operations for managing products in the shopping cart using Firebase (10 points)--Did not get to this point, still a work in progress and plan on finish it in the near future
Code quality, organization, and documentation (3 points)
Creativity and additional features/improvements ( Bonus 5 points)
